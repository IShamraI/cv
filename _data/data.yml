    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      Currently, full-time QA Lead at BPC Banking Technologies. After a successful path as a QA specialist, I've changed the focus to automation and my team. I have a lot of ideas on how to improve my work, my team's work, and testing processes, but I can't clone myself to realize it. That the main reason for changing the focus, since I can do only limited work, but my team can realize more.
